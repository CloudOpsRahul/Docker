Deploying a two-tier application with Docker-compose involves defining a YAML file to specify the services, networks, and volumes for a multi-container application. It simplifies the deployment of front-end and back-end components, enabling efficient scaling and orchestration of containers. Docker-compose streamlines the setup, configuration, and interconnection of these components, making it easier to manage and run the application.
